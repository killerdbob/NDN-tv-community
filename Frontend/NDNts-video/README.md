NDNts adaptive video is a video player for the NDN testbed.
This project is built with [NDNts](https://yoursunny.com/p/NDNts/), Named Data Networking libraries for the modern web.
This project demonstrates these NDNts capabilities:

* Use NDNts in a JavaScript project (instead of TypeScript).
* `fetch` function from `@ndn/segmented-object`.
  It uses CUBIC congestion control algorithm to retrieve video segments efficiently.
